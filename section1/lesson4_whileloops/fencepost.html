<!--
  Create a variable n and assign it an integer.
  Code a while loop that builds as a single string, the numbers 1 through n, separated by commas
  How can we make sure not to have a comma after the last number? e.g., for n = 9 print "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9"
  Use .textContent to place that string into a div#target in the HTML document.
  Now change your code to create a string full of <p> tags, with the number inside, and with <hr> dividers between them (but not after the last one), and use .innerHTML to place them into the page.
  Give odd numbers a class of "odd", even numbers a class of "even." Have a css rule inside your <style> tag that styles them differently.
